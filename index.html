    <p>I drive Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, but I'm happy I saw you today (Ayy, CGM, where you at?)
Ayy, ayy, I'm a geekboy 'til I'm in a box
She got goth ho swag, but it's Ricky
Don't like when I buy her shit, either want my money or she picky
But I'm happy I saw you today, I been looking all through the city

[Verse]
Wanna ruin my day? That's extra
Got a sold-out show, pay extra
New deal on the way, want a M
And the white folks know I got leverage
I'm a gemini lookin' for a Kim
Got a few Amber Rose, that's exes
I'm a drank head, but I hate Texas
Kind of camera shy, so I hate Cali
Met a bougie ass bitch that's messy
Hellcat's too loud for the valley
I'm a Ken doll in love with a Brat
Know a few G.I Joe's that'll wack you
And my pop so dark, think it's Tris
Four reds in the twenty ounce, nasty
And I don't wear Chrome unless it's Matty
And I make an appointment like Trent
I'm a mob boss, can't just hit me
Get geeked like Tune, but it's Fenty
Got a real boss bitch like Flacko
She'll wear my merch like Fenty
Finna cross my mans like Alpo
Put my grandmother's voice on the outro
Doing one twenty all up the shoulder
I ain't flirting with you, death, but we're closer
Giving luxury but junkie
Can't stop gettin' high with the money
And I'm happy I saw you today
I just know you finna ask me for money
On drugs, they clear, it's simple
No ashtray, fuck it, it's a rental
Out of sight, out of mind, it's mental
You might also like
[Chorus]
Damn, but I'm happy I saw you today
Ayy, ayy, I'm a geekboy 'til I'm in a box
She got goth ho swag, but it's Ricky
Don't like when I buy her shit, either want my money or she picky
But I'm happy I saw you today, I been looking all through the city

[Outro]
Luxury, but a junkie
Give her luxury, but a junkie
But I'm happy I saw you today
Ayy, ayy, luxury, but a junkie
Give her luxury, but a junkie
But I'm happy I saw you today</p>
